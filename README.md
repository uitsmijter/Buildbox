# Uitsmijter Buildbox

## Overview

The resulting containers contains tools needed to build Uitsmijters incremental run unit tests.

As it is based on the official [Swift Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/swift) it supports all tools needed for swift development out of the box.
Additional tools are listed in [Usage](#Usage).

A second container contains all tools that are needed to run the End-To-End-tests.
